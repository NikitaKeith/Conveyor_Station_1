The project in TIA Portal with DP via ProfiNet

PLC: Siemens

Funktion: 

Station 1: Station must put down one pallet onto the belt and transport it to the next belt. Then the next pallet is puted down onto the tape and it is transported further to station 2
Because there is a magnet at each corner of the pallet that activates the sensor, the shutdown of conveyor 1 occurs when the sensor is activated for the second time at the end of the conveyor.

Station 2: Station lays on a pallet a container and transports it further to station 3
